Split your company paychecks and badges with ease!

Thank you for visiting my little project! i am a python newbie and enthusiast and i'm trying to develepo a little program by myself to help me in my everyday life at my office.

FAQ:

- WHY ARE YOU DEVELOPING THIS PROGRAM?
i work at a small office in Italy, we send our paychecks and monthly badges via Telegram and once in a month we have to split two big .pdf file into single paychecks and badges. We couldn't use an ordinary pdf splitter to divide paychecks since they may be two-sided sheets and that may vary month by month. This said i tried to develepo a little console application to divide both paychecks and badges to fullfill this need

- HOW DOES IT WORK?
i tried to keep it most easy as possible. by the time i'm writing this the application waits for input and then splits the input into separate files (splits the paycheck pdf in "BUSTE PAGA" folder and the badges file in "CARTELLINI" folder) renaming them with the name of the respective worker. Both of those folder will be created if they do not exist in the same script directory.

- WILL YOU IMPLEMENT ENGLISH LANGUAGE AS WELL?
i will surely try but keep in mind this project is kept alive in my free time and i may not be working on it regularly. Feel free to pull the code and work on it to change it as you please, anyway! i just ask to be in some kind of credit in your code if you do :)

- HOW ARE YOU PLANNING TO EXPAND THIS?
as i said i'm a newbie of programming. This single application will be probably implemented in a bigger suite of minor utilities, not gonna lie i didn't think about this when i started coding this little program so this can become everything depending on what will be needed in my office.

- WHY BUSINESSCAT?
dunno i just like to give it a funny name i guess :)


I'm at your total disposal for any doubt about the code or if you need any help using it!
